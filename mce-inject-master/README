mce-inject allows to inject machine check errors on the 
software level into a running Linux kernel. This is intended for
validation of the kernel machine check handler.

Syntax:

mce-inject input-file ..

See the manpage for the input language

Some simple tests are in test/*.

Warning: some of them will panic the machine (this is intended)

Requires a Linux 2.6.31+ kernel with CONFIG_X86_MCE_INJECT 
enabled and the mce-inject module loaded (if not built in)

The official git tree for this project is on
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/cpu/mce/mce-inject.git

A more comprehensive test suite testing much more machine check features
using this program is available in mce-test
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/cpu/mce/mce-test.git
