.SH NAME
mcelog.conf \- mcelog.conf reference
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /etc/mcelog.conf
.SH DESCRIPTION

/etc/mcelog.conf is the main configuration file for 
.B mcelog(8).
This is configuration file separated into sections including 
a default section.


General format
.PP
.B optionname = value
.PP
White space is not allowed in value currently, except at the end where it is dropped

.PP
.PP
In general all command line options that are not commands work here.
See man mcelog or mcelog --help for a list.
e.g. to enable the --no-syslog option use 
.PP
.B no-syslog = yes   (or no to disable)
.PP
When the option has a argument
.PP
.B logfile = /tmp/logfile
.PP
Below are the options which are not command line options.
.PP
.PP
Set cpu type for which mcelog decodes events:
.PP
.B cpu = type
.PP
For valid values for type please see mcelog --help.
If this value is set incorrectly the decoded output will be likely incorrect.
By default when this parameter is not set mcelog uses the CPU it is running on
on very new kernels the mcelog events reported by the kernel also carry
the CPU type which is used too when available and not overriden.
.PP
.PP
Enable daemon mode:
.PP
.B daemon = yes
.PP
By default mcelog just processes the currently pending events and exits.
In daemon mode it will keep running as a daemon in the background and poll
the kernel for events and then decode them.
.PP
.PP
Filter out known broken events by default.
.PP
.B filter = yes
.PP
Don't log memory errors individually.
They still get accounted if that is enabled.
.PP
.B filter-memory-errors = yes
.PP
.PP
Output in undecoded raw format to be easier machine readable
(default is decoded).
.PP
.B raw = yes
.PP
.PP
Set cpu mhz to decode uptime from time stamp counter (output
unreliable, not needed on new kernels which report the event time
directly. A lot of systems don't have a linear time stamp clock
and the output is wrong then. 
Normally mcelog tries to figure out if it the TSC is reliable
and only uses the current frequency then.
Setting a frequency forces timestamp decoding.
This setting is obsolete with modern kernels which report the time 
directly.
.PP
.B cpumhz = 1800.00
.PP
.PP
Log output options
Log decoded machine checks in syslog (default stdout or syslog for daemon)	     
.PP
.B syslog = yes
.PP
Log decoded machine checks in syslog with error level
.PP
.B syslog-error = yes
.PP
Never log anything to syslog
.PP
.B no-syslog = yes     
.PP
Append log output to logfile instead of stdout. only when no syslog logging is active   
.PP
.B logfile = filename
.PP
.PP
Use smbios information to decode dimms (needs root).
This function is not recommended to use right now and generally not needed.
The exception is memdb prepopulation, which is configured separately below.
.PP
.B dmi = no
.PP
.PP
When in daemon mode run as this user after set up.
Note that the triggers will run as this user too.
Setting this to non root will mean that triggers cannot take some corrective
action, like offlining objects.
.PP
.B run-credentials-user = root
.PP
.PP
Group to run as daemon with
default to the group of the run-credentials-user
.PP
.B run-credentials-group = nobody
.PP
.PP
.SS "The server config section"
User allowed to access client socket.
when set to * match any
root is always allowed to access.
default: root only
.PP
.B client-user = root
.PP
Group allowed to access mcelog
When no group is configured any group matches (but still user checking).
when set to * match any
.PP
.B client-group = root
.PP
Path to the unix socket for client<->server communication.
When no socket-path is configured the server will not start
.PP
.B socket-path = /var/run/mcelog-client
.PP
When mcelog starts it checks if a server is already running. this configures the timeout
for this check.
.PP
.B initial-ping-timeout = 2 
.PP

.PP
.SS "The dimm config section"
Is the in memory dimm error tracking enabled?
Only works on systems with integrated memory controller and
which are supported.
Only takes effect in daemon mode.
.PP
.B dimm-tracking-enabled = yes
.PP
Use dmi information from the bios to prepopulate dimm database.
Note this might not work with all BIOS and requires mcelog to run as root.
Alternative is to let mcelog create DIMM objects on demand.
.PP
.B dmi-prepopulate = yes
.PP

Execute these triggers when the rate of corrected or uncorrected
Errors per DIMM exceeds the threshold.
Note when the hardware does not report DIMMs this might also
be per channel.
The default of 10/24h is reasonable for server quality 
DDR3 DIMMs as of 2009/10.
.PP
.B uc-error-trigger = dimm-error-trigger
.PP
.B uc-error-threshold = 1 / 24h
.PP
.B ce-error-trigger = dimm-error-trigger
.PP
.B ce-error-threshold = 10 / 24h
.PP
.PP
.SS "The socket config section"
Enable memory error accounting per socket.
.PP
.B socket-tracking-enabled = yes
.PP
.PP
Threshold and trigger for uncorrected memory errors on a socket.
mem-uc-error-trigger = socket-memory-error-trigger
.PP
.PP
.B mem-uc-error-threshold = 100 / 24h
.PP
.PP
Trigger script for corrected memory errors on a socket.
.PP
.B mem-ce-error-trigger = socket-memory-error-trigger
.PP
.PP
Threshold on when to trigger a correct error for the socket.
.PP
.PP
.B mem-ce-error-threshold = 100 / 24h
.PP
.PP
 log socket error threshold explicitely?
.PP
.B mem-ce-error-log = yes
.PP
.PP
Trigger script for uncorrected bus error events
.PP
.B bus-uc-threshold-trigger = bus-error-trigger
.PP
.PP
Trigger script for uncorrected iomca erors
.PP
.B iomca-threshold-trigger = iomca-error-trigger
.PP
.PP
Trigger script for other uncategorized errors

.B unknown-threshold-trigger = unknown-error-trigger
.PP
.PP
.SS "The cache config section"
Processing of cache error thresholds reported by intel cpus.
.PP
.B cache-threshold-trigger = cache-error-trigger
.PP
.PP
Should cache threshold events be logged explicitely?
.PP
.B cache-threshold-log = yes
.PP
.PP
.SS "The page config section"
Memory error accouting per 4k memory page.
Threshold for the correct memory errors trigger script.
.PP
.B memory-ce-threshold = 10 / 24h
.PP
.PP
Trigger script for corrected errors.
memory-ce-trigger = page-error-trigger
.PP
.PP
Should page threshold events be logged explicitely?
.PP
.B memory-ce-log = yes
.PP
.PP
Specify the internal action in mcelog to exceeding a page error threshold
this is done in addition to executing the trigger script if available
off      no action
account  only account errors
soft     try to soft-offline page without killing any processes
         This requires an uptodate kernel. Might not be successfull.
hard     try to hard-offline page by killing processes
         Requires an uptodate kernel. Might not be successfull.
soft-then-hard   First try to soft offline, then try hard offlining
.PP
.B memory-ce-action = off|account|soft|hard|soft-then-hard
.PP
.B memory-ce-action = soft
.PP
.PP
.SS "The trigger config section"

.PP
.B children-max = 2
.PP
