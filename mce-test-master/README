MCE test suite
---------------

The MCE test suite is a collection of tools and test scripts for
testing the Linux RAS related features, including CPU/Memory error
containment and recovery, ACPI/APEI support etc.

For some more details on machine checks see http://www.mcelog.org

The goal is as follows:
1. cover most Linux kernel MCE processing code paths and features
2. cover functional test cases for all RAS related features
3. provide stress test cases for some RAS features, especially for
   memory part

In the Package
--------------

Here is a short description of what is included in the package

README
	This document

COPYING
	GNU General Public License

Makefile
	Top level make file for MCE test suite

bin/
	Some tools used by test drivers or test cases will be
	installed into this directory.

cases/*
	Contains all test cases, which may be organized in
	sub-directories, the interface of a class of test cases is a
	shell script under cases/, such as:
	   -- cases/soft-inj/panic/cases.sh
		is for test cases triggered by soft-inject and may cause system 
		panic during testing.
	   -- cases/apei-inj/ucr/cases.sh  
		is for test cases triggered by apei-inject.

doc/*
	Documentation for MCE test suites include howto and
	descriptions of every test case.

lib/*
	Contains some shell scripts, in which some common shell
	functions and variable definitions are defined to be used by
	multiple test drivers or test cases.

tools/*
	Some tools used by MCE test suites.

work/
	During test, some temporary file will be put in work directory.

groups/
	Where all scenarios files such as coverage/function/stress are placed

results/
	When test is done, the test log will be placed in this directory.
	Some test results such as coverage test result will be
	placed in sub-directory under results directory.

summary
	When test is done, a summary file in *date* format is placed here.

Test Instruction
----------------

Please refer to corresponding section in doc/howto.txt.

Very quick way to test this:
	1. be root
	2. make sure you have a kernel with CONFIG_X86_MCE_INJECT
	and CONFIG_HWPOISON_INJECT and soft-offlining support
	3. run "mcemenu"
