tinjpage

tinjpage is a coverage test for the hwpoison page recovery code
in the kernel. It tests different cases by putting pages
into different stages, triggering poison injection on them
and verifies the results.

tinjpage requires a kernel with MADV_POISON injection support and the
hwpoison testkit, but doesn't require a kernel tree and can be built directly with
make tinjpage

A few of the test cases are timing dependent and might require adjustment
to run successfully.
